# python PRACTICE

## 安装库文件
1. 打开windows powershell（shift + 鼠标右键     在桌面点击）
2. 查看pip list命令，pip版本以及安装的库目录
3. pip install matplotlib
4. 若失败，可能的问题又两个 
   * pip版本过低，升级pip。pip -m pip install --upgrade pip
   * 显示read timed out，使用命令pip install -U --timeout 1000 matplotlib
     * 也有说法是采用pip install -i <https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple> matplotlib（==未尝试==）
   * 该方法适用于安装各种包文件时出现的异常
   * python -m pip --default-timeout=1000 install matplotlib（该命令用于设置默认时间，使默认的等待时长延长）
5. OK

## 快速下载国外软件的方法

* 中科大镜像

## 电脑入门Python基础概念

* 解释器（负责将高级语言转换为计算机语言）例如python 3.8
* 编辑器（编写代码的工具）
  * 解释器自带的IDEL
  * Jupyter, Notebook, pycharm, spyder, wingIDE
* 包管理工具
  * pip（库、 包管理工具）

### 推荐的python配置

#### 3.8版本

直接在官网下载，自带IDEL和PIP

#### 3.7版本

==下载Anoacoda和pycharm==

The form of a primary publication must be ==essentially permanent== and be made available to both ==scientific community== and ==information-retrieval services==.

 

科学论文的定义问题一直被反复讨论，有两个原因。



* 开处方，开药方   
*  sometimes
*  a new researcher/ an early researcher/ a budding researcher
* amorphous -- having no define form/ a state of vague and unstructured



In the context of information globalization, how to exchange information has been belabored. Some people contend that sharing as much information as possible has  brought many advantages. But on the other hand, there are also quite a few people who strongly advocate that the information is too important to be shared freely. To my mind, different fields should adopt different attitudes. In the field of scientific research, we want better dissemination of information, in the business world, however, the pursuit of information disclosure is not desirable.

Parents are always trying to find ways to encourage healthy eating in their children. Different scientists and educators have different strategies for promoting a well-rounded diet while still encouraging body positivity in children. David R. Just and Joseph Price suggest in their article “Using Incentives to Encourage Healthy Eating in Children” that children are more likely to eat fruits and vegetables if they are given a reward (855-856). Similarly, Elena Pearl Ben-Joseph, a doctor and writer for Kids Health, encourages parents to be role models for their children. She states that “parents who are always dieting or complaining about their bodies may foster these same negative feelings in their kids. Try to keep a positive approach about food” (Ben-Joseph). Martha J. Nepper and Weiwen Chai support Ben-Joseph’s suggestions in their article “Parents’ Barriers and Strategies to Promote Healthy Eating among School-age Children.” Nepper and Chai note, “Parents felt that patience, consistency, educating themselves on proper nutrition, and having more healthy foods available in the home were important strategies when developing healthy eating habits for their children.”

One of my favoritate hometown food is terrific Youpo noodles.  It's ingredients are simple, including noodles, chili powder and bean sprouts.  It is not  complicated but delicious so that it is favored by the Shaanxi people. For me, choosing a bowl of noodles is more satisfiedthan rice.

## Winform

winform风洞力传感器程序完成，可调节端口，调节采样通道，以及傅里叶分析

485通信和TTL信号不同，TTL是根据电位高低进行采集信号，而485 只是一个数据的传输协议。

* 之前编写的采集数据软件不可用，可以用来采集传感器直接输出的信号；
* 购买了485转USB的串口，进行485通信，继而用Csharp进行后续处理。
* 其实可以用现成的Arduino进行串口通信，借此机会练习一下winform的通信。

### winform中问题

* JYTEK的report类库，存在与Office2019不兼容的问题，与2016和2013兼容良好。
* 插入板卡出现识别不了的问题，进入设备管理器进行查看板卡连结。绿色一直闪为正常采集。具体解决方法可以进入主板的BIOS进行设置SECURE---->disenable。
* JYTEK存在于电脑兼容问题。
